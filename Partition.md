# PostgreSQL Partitioning Guide

## Overview

Partitioning in PostgreSQL is a technique to divide large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces, while still being able to query them as a single table. This can improve performance and manageability of large datasets.

## Types of Partitioning

1. **Range Partitioning**: Divides data based on a range of values, such as dates or numerical ranges.
2. **List Partitioning**: Divides data based on a list of discrete values, such as categories or regions.
3. **Hash Partitioning**: Divides data based on a hash function, which distributes rows evenly across partitions.
4. **Composite Partitioning**: Combines multiple partitioning methods, such as range and list partitioning.

## Basic Concepts

- **Partitioned Table**: The main table that is divided into partitions.
- **Partitions**: Sub-tables that store the data in the main table based on partitioning criteria.
- **Partition Key**: The column used to determine how data is distributed among partitions.

## Examples

### 1. Range Partitioning

Suppose you have a table `orders` and you want to partition it by year.

#### Step 1: Create the Main Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount NUMERIC
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);
```

#### Step 2: Create Partitions

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders_2020 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2020-01-01') TO ('2020-12-31');

CREATE TABLE orders_2021 PARTITION OF orders
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2021-01-01') TO ('2021-12-31');
```

### 2. List Partitioning

Suppose you have a `customers` table and want to partition it by region.

#### Step 1: Create the Main Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    region TEXT NOT NULL
) PARTITION BY LIST (region);
```

#### Step 2: Create Partitions

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers_north PARTITION OF customers
    FOR VALUES IN ('North');

CREATE TABLE customers_south PARTITION OF customers
    FOR VALUES IN ('South');
```

### 3. Hash Partitioning

Suppose you have a `transactions` table and want to partition it using a hash function based on the `id` column.

#### Step 1: Create the Main Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    amount NUMERIC
) PARTITION BY HASH (id);
```

#### Step 2: Create Partitions

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions_part1 PARTITION OF transactions
    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 0);

CREATE TABLE transactions_part2 PARTITION OF transactions
    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 1);

CREATE TABLE transactions_part3 PARTITION OF transactions
    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 2);

CREATE TABLE transactions_part4 PARTITION OF transactions
    FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 4, REMAINDER 3);
```

### 4. Composite Partitioning

Suppose you have a `sales` table and want to partition it by year and then by region.

#### Step 1: Create the Main Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
    region TEXT NOT NULL,
    amount NUMERIC
) PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date);
```

#### Step 2: Create Year-Based Partitions

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_2020 PARTITION OF sales
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2020-01-01') TO ('2020-12-31') PARTITION BY LIST (region);
```

#### Step 3: Create Region-Based Partitions

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_2020_north PARTITION OF sales_2020
    FOR VALUES IN ('North');

CREATE TABLE sales_2020_south PARTITION OF sales_2020
    FOR VALUES IN ('South');
```

## Benefits of Partitioning

- **Improved Query Performance**: Queries can be faster as they only scan relevant partitions.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller partitions are easier to manage and maintain.
- **Efficient Data Management**: You can use partition-specific operations like `VACUUM` or `REINDEX`.

## Considerations

- **Partition Key Selection**: Choose the partition key based on your query patterns and data distribution.
- **Indexing**: Indexing needs to be managed on each partition separately.
- **Complexity**: Partitioning adds complexity to schema design and requires careful planning.

## Conclusion

Partitioning is a powerful feature in PostgreSQL that can help manage large datasets efficiently. 
By understanding and implementing the appropriate partitioning strategy, you can significantly improve the performance and maintainability of your database.
